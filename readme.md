# Random GIF generator

## Giphy API key
You need to replace {API_KEY} with a real Giphy API key in src/components/random-gif/random-gif.tsx

## Getting Started

To start building the Random GIF generator, clone this repo to a new directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-pwa-toolkit.git random-gif-generator
cd random-gif-generator
```

and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Production

To build your PWA for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```
A production build includes everything needed for your project to be a PWA right out of the box. This includes both a Web Manifest (src/manifest.json) and a Service Worker (www/sw.js).


## Hosting

For top PWA performance, your app should be hosted with a hosting provider that supports HTTPS and HTTP2 out of the box.

We currently recommend [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/).

### H2 Push

To ensure the fastest possible load time for your PWA, we recommend setting up H2 push on Firebase. [Here is an example](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-stencil-hn-app/blob/master/firebase.json#L19-L25) of what this looks like in your `firebase.json` file. Lets go over the steps of how to setup H2 push properly for your Ionic PWA:

- Do a production build of your PWA with `npm run build`
- Serve your WWW folder locally using a local http server and open it in Chrome. https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server works pretty well for this. If using the http-server package you can serve your www folder by running `http-server www`.
- Open Chrome Dev Tools on your PWA and open the [network tab of your chrome dev tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/reference). Reload the page and you should see all of your JS files show up in the network tab. Besides the `sw.js` file, these are the files you want to H2 push.
- You can then put these files in your push header setup by following this syntax https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-stencil-hn-app/blob/master/firebase.json#L23.

## Service Workers

For info on how Service Workers work in Stencil check out our [Service Worker docs](https://stenciljs.com/docs/service-workers).

## Developing with a Service Worker

In some cases, for instance when you are working on adding [web push notifications](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/push-notifications/) or [background sync](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/12/background-sync), both which require a Service Worker, it can be handy to be able to dev builds with a service worker.

To do this with the Ionic PWA toolkit simply run `npm run devWithSW`. This will start a dev build, but with the Service Worker also getting livereloaded.

## Lazy Loading Images

Check out the `lazy-img` component in `src/components/lazy-img/lazy-img.tsx`.

## Unit Tests

To run the unit tests once, run:

```
npm test
```

To run the unit tests and watch for file changes during development, run:

```
npm run test.watch
```

## Testing your PWA's performance

We recommend using https://www.webpagetest.org/easy with the `Run Lighthouse Audit` option turned on. This will give you an in depth look into your PWAs load performance on the average device connected to the average network.

## About the Ionic PWA Toolkit
The Ionic PWA Toolkit is the recommended way to build production ready Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) with Ionic. This toolkit gets you started with [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) and Ionic (4.x+). This combination of tools gives you the ability to build a fast, efficient PWA with zero config needed and best practices out of the box.
